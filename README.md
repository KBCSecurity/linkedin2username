# linkedin2username
OSINT Tool: Generate username lists from companies on LinkedIn. Works with Python2.

This is a pure web-scraper, no API key required. You use your valid LinkedIn username and password to login, it will create several lists of possible username formats for all employees of a company you point it at.

Use an account with a lot of connections, otherwise you'll get crappy results.

Here's what you get:
- first.last.txt: Usernames like Joe.Schmoe
- flast.txt:      Usernames like JSchmoe
- firstl.txt:     Usernames like JoeS
- rawnames.txt:   Full name like Joe Schmoe

# Example
Here's an example to pull all employees of Uber:
```
$ python linkedin2username.py myname@email.com 361843 uber.com
```

Here's how to get that company ID (I will automate this later):
1. Log in to LinkedIn
2. Find a comapny's overview page (ie https://www.linkedin.com/company/uber/)
3. Hover over "See all xxx employees on LinkedIn"
4. Look for the ID number in "facetCurrentCompany" in the URL. (Uber is 361843).
